        <h2>The Golden Record</h2>
        <p>Carl Sagan was task with the job of the golden record to have a message from the people of Earth.
            The Golden record was for any life form in outerspace to come across it and learn about Earth and 
            its people. The record had a map its a diagram of where we are located in the galaxy. It also had
            the sounds of Earth's muusic, animals and the languages of all humans on it. This is a symbol of 
            us and who we are as a planetary species. Voyager 1 was ahead of its time and so where the people that
            worked on the craft and all its components it is the embodiment of humanity and all its desire to explore
            the cosmos.</p>

        <h3>Voyager's twin</h3>

        

        <p>
            Voyager 2 was the twin of voyager 1 and it actully went up before voyager 1 due to trajectory windows and becuase
            the tasks for each was different. Voyager 2 had to two more planets being Unranus and then Neptune. Voayger 2 
            is just like the first craft and also has a golden record on board. Voyager 2 also has a deep journey through space.
            Voyager 1 and 2 are both still functional and we are still recieving data back from both spacecraft. Voyager 1 and 2 are now billions
            of billions of miles from us and are still holding up it is a true show of engineering and skill of Nasa and its people.
