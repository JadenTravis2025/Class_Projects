      <h2>Rocket Upgrades</h2>
      <hr>
      <p> The rockets designed for the new space craft is like no other.
         The core stage with 4 RS-25 engines filled with hydrogen
         and liquid oxygen start its intial lift off along with the two side boosters.
         The rs-25s make 2 million pounds of thrust. The booster have 7.2 giving a total of 8.8
         million pounds of thrust. this is about a 15% power boost compared to the Saturn 5 rocket engines.
          Overall the SLS got some nice upgrades including faster liftoff and pad clearing time.
          It also has a upgraded upper stage for more cargo and which in turn allows longer operation time. 
          The Artemis rocket is now the most powerful rocket ever made and since it bigger this means multi missions will 
          be assigned.
