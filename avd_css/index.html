        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The artemis program is bringing us back to the moon. But this time we will be here to stay
            and establish a lunar presence. The program will set up by three stages. The first will not
            have a crew aboard this is just a test flight of the 2 crafts orion and the SLS. now for 
            the second it will be manned and this will be a true test of the spacecrafts. Its goal is to 
            orbit around the moon and return back to there home planet. The third stage of this program 
            is the true first step of the Artemis program. This will be histroric, it has been 50 years since
            humans have set foot on the lunar surface.

        <h3>Mission Tasks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Launch the Orion spacecraft aboard the Space Launch System</li>
          <li>Conduct crewed lunar flybys and landings</li>
          <li>Set up lunar gateway</li>
          <li>Contruction of lunar base</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scientific Objectives</h2>
        <p>The Scientific obejective for the program once landed on the moon will be a tasks 
            of multiple lunar studies. The moon hides secrets with the consatant bombardment of
            comets and meteorites on its back side. This means ice could be buried deep inside the
            crust. The LCROSS has comfirmed this. This will benefit humanity in ways we cannot imagine.
            For instance water is what is needed for life on the moon this will help us when the base is established
            for long stays on the lunar surface. Billions of kilograms of water is waiting to be found and studied.

    <h3>On The Shoulders Of Giants</h3>
    <p>This program is a direct call back to the 1960s and 70s at the height of exploration. Apollo 
        was the program that started it all. Long term space exploration was changed by this rigerous 
        program. Niel Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins we the big three to make it to the moon 
        and have a full mission to land and rejoin back to command module and head back home. Apollo had 3 
        Astronuats per mission two land on the moon and one will orbit. Artemis will be just a little different 
        having 4 per mission two on the moon and two in the orbiter.
