          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Artemis program is bringing us back to the Moon. This time we will be here to stay
            and establish a lunar presence. The program will be set up in three stages. The first will not
            have a crew aboard — it is just a test flight of the two crafts: Orion and the SLS.  
            The second will be manned and will be a true test of the spacecrafts, with the goal to 
            orbit around the Moon and return to Earth.  
            The third stage is the true first step of the Artemis program. This will be historic — it's been 50 years since
            humans have set foot on the lunar surface.

          <h2>Scientific Objectives</h2>
          <p>
            The scientific objective for the program, once landed on the Moon, will be a series 
            of multiple lunar studies. The Moon hides secrets due to the constant bombardment of
            comets and meteorites on its far side. This means ice could be buried deep inside the
            crust — the LCROSS mission has confirmed this.  
            This will benefit humanity in ways we cannot imagine. For instance, water is essential 
            for life on the Moon and will help sustain a base for long stays on the lunar surface.  
            Billions of kilograms of water are waiting to be found and studied.

    <h3>On the Shoulders of Giants</h3>
    <p>
      This program is a direct call back to the 1960s and 70s at the height of exploration. Apollo 
      was the program that started it all. Long-term space exploration was changed by this rigorous 
      program. Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins were the big three to make it to the Moon 
      and complete a full mission to land, rejoin the command module, and return home.  
      Apollo had three astronauts per mission — two landed on the Moon and one orbited.  
      Artemis will be slightly different, having four per mission — two on the Moon and two in the orbiter.
