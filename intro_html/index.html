        <h1>Artemis Program Introduction</h1>
        <hr> 
        <h2>Artemis Flights</h2>
        <p>The Artemis program is design to get us back to the moon. The Program is meant for long to space explorations of our moon. They will try to setup nuclear reactors for substainable life in habitation mudules.
        The program will include the new Artemis rocket which will be used to place our three new astronuats on the moon.

<h3>Program specifics</h3>

<p>Artemis has 3 missions before landing on our lunar surface phase 1 is completed it was a test flight to validate the rocket systems.
        The second phase is to test the SLS rocket to the moon and back with our astronuats on board. And for the last mission they will finally setup a lunar strong hold.
        Four astronuats will be sent to the moon, one will orbit and the other two will be on the surface! This program is named after its twin program The Apollo!
</p>
       <p>The final phase is setting up nuclear reactors on the moon for the habitation modules. There will also be a stargate placed into the orbit of the moon to man lunar travel more safe and it will allow it to be done more often.
        And finally they are wanting to get set up for future mars missions. The artemis program is a call back to our roots as a civilization.
